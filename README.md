Gameboy emulator written in Node.js
---
(almost) Fully customizable `config.json` file. Able to change menu button labels, keybinds, theme, audio, and more.\
Has Discord RPC support to show information like what ROM you're playing.\
Audio works, but awful to listen to so muted by default.\
To-do: Save states, better performance, make FPS display actually show FPS and not just solid 60
